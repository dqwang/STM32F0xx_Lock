	RTC Hardware Calendar Description

	Example Description

This example demonstrates and explains how to use the RTC peripheral.
As an application example, it demonstrates how to setup the RTC peripheral, in
terms of prescaler and interrupts, to be used to keep time and to generate
alarm interrupt.

One of the following clock source can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c):
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The RTC is in the backup (BKP) domain, still powered by VBAT when VDD is switched off,
so the RTC configuration is not lost if a battery is connected to the VBAT pin.
A key value is written in backup data register 0 to indicate if the RTC is already
configured

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:
    - BKP_DR0 value not correct: (RTC_BKP_DR0 value is not correct or has not yet
      been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
      configured and the user is asked to set the time and alarm (entered on
      HyperTerminal).
      LED2 is truned ON when the RTC configuration is done correctly.

    - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      and Alarm A are displayed on HyperTerminal.

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost.

3. When power on reset occurs:
    - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is not reset and
      the RTC configuration is not lost.

    - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is reset and the
      RTC configuration is lost.

4. When an RTC Alarm A event occurs the RTC Alarm interrupt is generated and the
   LED1 is toggled.

The example uses HyperTerminal to configure the RTC clock and display the current time:
 - When Joystcick SEL button is pressed, a menu is displayed to configure the RTC Time
   and Alarm A registers.
 - When TAMPER button is pressed, the current time is displayed.
 - When Joystcick UP button is pressed, the current alarm A is displayed.

	RTC_LSI RTC prescaler adjustment with LSI Measurements example

	Example Description

This example demonstrates and explains how to use the LSI clock source auto
calibration to get a precise RTC clock.
As an application example, it demonstrates how to configure the TIM14 timer
internally connected to LSI clock output, in order to adjust the RTC prescaler.

The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source.
After reset, the RTC prescaler (asynchronous and synchronous) is set with the
default LSI frequency (40KHz).
The RTC Alarm is configured to generate an interrupt each 1s. LED1 is toggled
inside the RTC WakeUp interrupt each 1s.

The inaccuracy of the LSI clock causes the RTC Alarm Interrupt to be inaccurate.
The RTC CK_SPRE signal can be monitored by LED1 which is toggled into the RTC
Alarm_A interrupt service routine.

The program waits until TAMPER Push button is pressed to begin the auto calibration
procedure:
 - Configure the TIM14 to remap internally the TIM14 Channel 1 Input Capture to
   the LSI clock output.
 - Enable the TIM14 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
   period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
   its real value.
 - The RTC prescaler is adjusted with this LSI frequency value so that the RTC
   CK_SPRE value become more accurate.
 - When calibration is done LED2 is turned ON to indicate the end of this operation.

	RTC StopWatch example

	Example Description

  This example illustrates how to use the STM32F0xx new RTC's sub-seconds and
  Tamper feature (Filter, sampling) features. It simulates a precise chronometer
  with 2 record times possibilities stored in the Backup registers (2 registers
  for time (second, minutes and hours) and 2 registers for subsecond).

  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
   LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use StopWatch with real time display.

  After startup, a default 00:00:00:000 chronometer counter is displayed on the
  LCD, it corresponds to [Hours]:[minutes]:[seconds]:[milliseconds].
  User can manipulate the chronometer features using Joystick LEFT, RIGHT and Tamper buttons:
    - press Joystick LEFT  button to start counter.
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to save trials in the backup registers (max 5 actions).
    - press and hold Tamper button for 1 sec to reset all the backup registers.

	RTC Timer example

	Example Description

  This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral’s with
  Alarm sub seconds feature to simulate a timer with refresh time equal to 250 ms
  (1 second/ 8) * 2).
  The RTC is configured to generate sub seconds interrupt each 125ms (will have
  8 interrupt per 1 second).

  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
  STM320xx_EVAL’s LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use Timer with a real
  progress bar display.

  After startup, the timer is equal to 1 Minute (60 Seconds) and by pressing on
  the Tamper button the progress bar start to be filled for each 2 successive
  interrupts (after each 250ms).
  After 480 interrupts (60 * 8) the progress bar will be full.

  User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Tamper and Wakeup buttons:
    - press Sel button to Start the timer.
    - press Tamper button to stop the timer.

	RTC Tamper example

	Example Description

This example shows how to write/read data to/from RTC Backup data registers and
demonstrates the Tamper detection feature.

One from the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c):
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The associated firmware performs the following:
1. It configures the Tamper pin to be falling edge, and enables the Tamper interrupt.
2. It writes the data to all RTC Backup data registers, then check whether the
   data were correctly written. If yes, LED1 turns on, otherwise LED3 turns on.
3. On applying a low level on the RTC_AF1 pin (PC.13, connected to Tamper button),
   the RTC backup data registers are reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated.
   The corresponding ISR then checks whether the RTC Backup data registers are cleared.
   If yes LED2 turns ON, otherwise LED4 turns ON.

  - LSI oscillator clock

The program behaves as follow:

1. At startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:
    - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      date and timestamp (time and date) are displayed.

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost.

3. When power on reset occurs:
    - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin :
      the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration is not lost.

    - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin :
      the BKP domain is reset and the RTC configuration is lost.

4. It configures the RTC TimeStamp pin to be falling edge and enables the
TimeStamp detection.

5. Applying a low level on the TimeStamp pin (PC.13) by pressing TAMPER push button,
the calendar is saved in the time-stamp registers thanks to the timestamp event detection.

The example uses HyperTerminal to configure the RTC clock, display the current
time and timestamp registers contents:
 - Pressing TAMPER push button, saves the current time and date in RTC TSTR
   and TSDR registers and  displays the current RTC Calendar (Time and date) and
   RTC TimeStamp Calendar (Time and date). LED2 turns ON.
 - Pressing SEL push button, clears the TimeStamp Calendar. LED1 turns ON.
