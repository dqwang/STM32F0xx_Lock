CAN Dual FIFO example

Example Description

This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive
CAN frames in normal mode and using FIFO0 and FIFO1. The sent frames are used to control Leds
by pressing TAMPER or SEL push buttons.
For the sent frames two different standard identifiers are used: "0x321" is used when
pressing SEL and the other one (0x123) is transmitted by pressing on TAMPER push button .

The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

when the program is executed for the first time, it behaves as follows:
  - All leds are Off.
  - Pressing on SEL Button first will turn ON LED1 and all other Leds are OFF, on the N
    eval boards connected to the bus.

  - Each press on SEL button will send CAN Frame to command LEDn+1 ON, all other Leds
    are OFF on the N eval boards.

  - Pressing on TAMPER Button first will turn ON LED4 all other Leds are OFF, on the N
    eval boards connected to the bus.

  - Each press on TAMPER Button will send CAN Frame to command LEDn-1 ON, all other Leds
    are OFF on the N eval boards.

  - The USER can use TAMPER and SEL in the same time to Control LEDs.

 note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is
      loaded in all units to send and receive frames.
 note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing TAMPER/SEL button)
      or receiver.

The CAN is configured as follow:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
    - ID Filter for FIFO0: 0x123 identifiers are allowed
    - ID Filter for FIFO1: 0x321 identifiers are allowed
    - RTR = Data
    - DLC = 1 byte
    - Data: Led number that should be turned ON

CAN FIFO Extension example

Example Description

This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive
CAN frames in normal mode using FIFO0 and FIFO1. This application example shows
how to manage the both CAN FIFO as a single FIFO composed by 6 mail boxes.

The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

This program behaves as follows:
  - By Pressing on TAMPER Button : 6 messages are sent to the N eval boards
    connected to the bus and the received messages are displayed on the LCD
    each time 6 messages are sent.

 note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is
      loaded in all units to send and receive frames.
 note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing TAMPER button)
      or receiver.

The CAN is configured as follow:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
    - ID Filter  = All identifiers are allowed
    - RTR = Data
    - DLC = 1 byte
    - Data: Led number that should be turned ON

CAN LoopBack example

Example Description

This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the CAN
in loopback mode.

The CAN cell first performs a transmission and a reception of a standard data
frame by polling at 125 Kbps. The received frame is checked and some LEDs light
up to indicate whether the communication was successful. Then, an extended data
frame is transmitted at 500 Kbps. Reception is done in the interrupt handler
when the message becomes pending in the FIFO. Finally, the LEDs indicate if both
transmission and reception have been successful.
In polling mode, if communication succeeded LED1 turned ON otherwise LED3 is ON.
In Interrupt mode, if communication succeeded LED4 turned ON otherwise LED2 is ON.
