How to use it ?

 - Open the Project.eww workspace.
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
     - STM32F051: to configure the project for STM32F051 devices.
                  You can use STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL or STM32F0-Discovery
                  board to run this project.
                  
     - STM32F031: to configure the project for STM32F031devices.
                  You need to use custom HW board to run this project.

     - STM32F030: to configure the project for STM32F030 devices.
                  You can use STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL or STM32F0308-Discovery
                  board to run this project.
                  
     - STM32F072: to configure the project for STM32F072 devices.
                  You need to use custom STM32072B-EVAL or STM32F072B-Discovery
                  board to run this project.
                  
     - STM32F042: to configure the project for STM32F042 devices.
                  You need to use custom HW board to run this project.
                                  
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)


 note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
      preprocessor section: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER, STM32F0XX, USE_STM320XXX_EVAL
